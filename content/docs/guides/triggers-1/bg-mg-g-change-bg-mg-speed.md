# 1: Recap

In case you haven't read the editor guides, here is a quick recap of how backgrounds, midgrounds, and grounds work. Geometry Dash has a variety of backgrounds and grounds you can use, with midgrounds being added in Update 2.2.

To change any of these options, go to the {{< img src="images/GDEmotes/Buttons/Settings.png" class="emote" >}} Level Settings page and set them through the UI given. Note that if you're playing on version 2.200 (such as being on mobile), adding a MG to your level will permanently lock you out of the editor.

# 2: BG, MG, & G Change Triggers

{{< img src="images/GDEmotes/Triggers/BGChange.png" class="largeemote >}} {{< img src="images/GDEmotes/Triggers/MGChange.png" class="largeemote" >}} {{< img src="images/GDEmotes/Triggers/GChange.png" class="largeemote" >}} These triggers let you change the BG, MG, and G currently in your level. Their UIs all look somewhat like this when you click go to the {{< img src="images/GDEmotes/Buttons/EditObject.png" class="emote" >}} Edit Object.

When you click on the button in the middle, you'll be able to select a new BG, MG, or G for your level. You may also make these triggers Touch or Spawn Triggered of course.

# 3: BG & MG Speed Triggers

{{< img src="images/GDEmotes/Triggers/BGSpeed.png" class="largeemote" >}} {{< img src="images/GDEmotes/Triggers/MGSpeed.png" class="largeemote" >}} These triggers let you change the speed at which your BG and MG move.

The **Mod X** and **Mod Y** values are the same as in the Follow trigger and set the speed of the BG and MG. A value of 1 makes the BG move at the camera's speed, while a value of 0 makes it stop entirely.

By default these are set to 0.1, but there are other criteria which determine how fast they move - most notably the {{< img src="images/GDEmotes/Triggers/TimeWarp.png" class="largeemote" >}} Timewarp trigger and your speed changes.

# 4: MidGround Trigger

You may also change the position of your level's MG using this trigger. As with the Move trigger you can input an offset, set a move time, and add an easing. As always, this can be touch-triggered and spawn-triggered.

# 5: Additional BG Changes

If you are bored with the default backgrounds that GD offers, you can make your own custom ones with unique designs and movements. You can learn more about decorating custom backgrounds by reading [another guide](/docs/guides/deco-1/making-backgrounds/) here.
